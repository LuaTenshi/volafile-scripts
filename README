The scripts in this repository should be considered experimental/alpha/beta scripts, therefore not recommended for use. 
However, if you do want to risk having a broken userscript, go ahead and install one of the usersripts from this repository.

The advantage of installing from this repository is that scripts will be updated a bit sooner than the ones on lg188's repository (heavily depends on if lg188 is online or not).

I do recommend though that you install the scripts from lg188's repository instead of my repository.
